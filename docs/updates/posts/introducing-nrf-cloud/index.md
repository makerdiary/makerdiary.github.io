## Key Features of nRF Cloud

- __Device Management__: Easily onboard, monitor, and manage your IoT devices at scale. Track device health, connectivity status, and performance in real-time.

- __Data Visualization__: Transform raw sensor data into actionable insights with customizable dashboards. Visualize trends, anomalies, and key metrics to make informed decisions.

- __Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates__: Securely deploy firmware updates to devices in the field, ensuring they stay up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.

- __Seamless Integration__: Fully compatible with Nordic’s nRF91 Series and nRF Connect SDK.

- __Security__: Built-in security features, including end-to-end encryption and secure boot, protect your devices and data from threats.

- __Scalability__: Allow you to seamlessly scale from a few devices on a pilot run to thousands of devices on a production deployment.


## Benefits of nRF Cloud

- __Built from the ground-up for low power__: Ultra-low power is in Nordic's DNA. Everything we offer to our customers across hardware, software and cloud services, is optimized for ultra-low power. 

- __Agnostic connectivity transport__: nRF Cloud can be accessed via device-to-cloud or cloud-to-cloud mechanisms, to ensure it fits a variety of use-cases and system architectures.

- __Standalone services and pricing__: Individual selection of services and features allows for a flexible adoption that meets your needs, and pricing plan options that fit the scale of your business.

- __Full lifecycle support__: nRF Cloud services can be leveraged across your product's entire lifecycle, from production to field decommissioning, reducing costs associated with proprietary infrastructure.
